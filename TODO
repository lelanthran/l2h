=================================================================
Implement tokeniser to escape characters. Needed for representing
actual '(' and ')' in the source.

Probably not a bad idea to also test that stuff in quoted strings
doesn't get mangled (don't think so, though; the code for that
is so simple it's embarrassing - once a quote being read, everything
is captured verbatim by the tokeniser).
