=================================================================
Must find a suitable way to remove the space that is inserted
after a tag.

For example, to represent "Hel<b>l</b>o", there is no way, as the
tag automatically includes the space when represented as sexps:
"Hel(b l)0".

Two options:
1. Include a special escape sequence to indicate nospace after
   the tag. For example, using \b as the indicator:
      He(b\bl)lo
2. Don't tokenise spaces immediately after a tag - i.e. when the
   tag is read, swallow the next character if it is whitespace.
3. When parsing, drop any whitespace or newline tokens following
   the list token (tag tokens are called list tokens).
4. When emitting, skip the next node if it is a whitespace or
   newline node.
