Think about variables and templating some more.
1. (.set <name> <value>) looks good, but we may also want to use
   a <value> that is a subtree. Don't really want to go for
   Lisp-quote character, but I don't see an alternative.

2. (.get <name) could work nicely; the `.get` tree can be easily
   replaced with the result of the symbol table lookup.

For ease-of-use, maybe start with something simple, only set
text so ...
   (.set-text <name> <value>)
and then use $<name> everywhere that text variable is used.

=================================================================




=================================================================
Implement `.import`; there's two basic approaches:
1. Use it as a module import, which is pointless at this point
   because there is no variables and templates that can be used.
2. Use `.include` to include a file verbatimo, like the way LaTeX
   and the C preprocessor does it. This at least allows including
   common snippets which are stored in other files (headers,
   footers, etc).

I think `.import` won't be useful until variables and templates
are implemented, while `.include` can be useful immediately for
common content.

Mutually recursive includes will, of course, crash the processor,
so it is important to produce some nice error messages or
maintain a tree so that, any time an include is performed we
check the tree to ensure that we are not including a file that
is already in the include-tree.

=================================================================
Remove the constraint that files must end in `.html.lisp`. Too
many lispers are annoyed that this isn't a Lisp in the first
place, and if they were to ever use this program they'd be even
more annoyed.

Maybe use the filename `.html.l2h` instead.

Make the speed-test.sh script also check the md5sums of all the
generated files against the reference file.

Lots of excellent feedback from HN exposure:
1. From George Z: use `(. some text)` for parenthetical text.
2. From Junon: Tag templates - a macro that expands in a (maybe)
   semi-intelligent manner so that authors can create their own
   reusable macros.
3. From Junon: import statments. 'Nuff said.
4. Many were not impressed by the superficial resemblance to
   written Lisp. Maybe rename the project, or, if that is too
   extreme, emphasise that `l2h` is *not* a Lisp dialect.
5. From zarzavat: tighten up attributes; removing '=' makes
   the expression more macro-friendly (See Junon's suggestion
   above). More than one way to remove '='.

=================================================================
Include doctype options for the command-line. For now it is
probably sufficient to simply use a boolean flag that sets the
string "<!DOCTYPE HTML>" and insist that users be aware that only
HTML5 is supported.

In the future, maybe allow user to set the doctype string
themselves, on the command-line. Maybe also allow the user, via
c/line flags, to set every other once-off unbalanced tags.
=================================================================


=================================================================
Support comments.

1. Not too sure about the best way - hijacking a comment tag
   stomps all over the namespace of HTML. For example, easy to
   allow comments like this:
     (comment this is a comment)
       => "<!-- this is a comment -->
   but then if the page has <comment> elements in it (not
   impossible in the future, or if a dev produced a poorly named
   custom element) then that element will never be in the output.

2. Use lisp-ish comments - everything from ';' to end of line is
   a comment. The problem with this is that the user then needs
   to escape their semicolons, like this "retry\; abort\; fail?".

#1 above can be mitigated by allowing the user to set, via the
c/line, their own symbol for comments, so if there is a clash the
user can pick something other than "comment" as the comment
element/tag.

If HTML was balanced we wouldn't have a problem - comments would
be indicated like this:
   "<!--> this is a comment </!-->
or like this:
   "<!-- this is a comment />

But nooooo ...

Some Very Smart Persons back in the 60's decided that the SGML
language shouldn't be balanced. Can't really blame them, all of
the research, knowledge and wisdom around regular languages and
CFGs, and PFAs, etc was still in its infancy.

The 60s people definitely did not have the benefit of seeing the
implementation in widespread use by billions of people, using
100s of thousands of applications, all relying on their
descendant of SGML.

OTOH, the Very Smart Persons in the early 90s who took SGML and
used it basically unmodified for HTML *should have known better*,
as by that point SGML was already being implemented for decades
and those implementors would have come across the same problem of
not having a language that exclusively had balanced tags.

Those early 90s people are not completely to blame either - they
simply did not know what their little document publishing and
exchange system would become. After all, documents were written
by hand, so who cared if HTML contained a multitude of exceptions
to the general rule of "<tag>...</tag>", because the human
writing it certainly knew what the exceptions were.

And then we come to late-90s, where some more self-appointed Very
Smart Persons, who had the benefit of working with a mature and
well-understood language, decided, when steering HTML, to *keep
the unbalanced nature of HTML after version 2.0!*

Yeah, yeah, backwards compatibility, and all that, but at that
early time in early 2000s, they could have jettisoned the
baggage, moved to a balanced-tags-only grammar, and we'd all be
better off.

So what we do now is code a tree, that somehow contains elements
that are *not* part of the tree, yet still exists within it.
